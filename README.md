# Exploring-Exoplanet-Data
## Introduction
I explore the currently available exoplanet data to answer the following questions posed in order of complexity:

1. How are the planets distributed on the sky?
2. Can we observe Keplerâ€™s Third Law? Is it different for different discovery methods?
3. Why do we observe so many Hot-Jupiters?
4. Of all the exoplanets discovered to date, what type of stars do the planets typically orbit?
5. How many planets are located in the habitable zone? Are any of them like Earth?

The data story is published on Medium at https://astroryan97.medium.com/analyzing-exo-planet-data-92b15b28da29
